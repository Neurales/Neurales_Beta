# What is Neurales?

Neurales is an easy way to use machine learning. We wrote all the code in a customizeable and modular way so you can focus on everything else.

All rights reserved by S.E.R.R.I Technologies, LLC (Owner of Neurales)
	Website: https://neurales.ai/
	

Currently Neurales has nine customizable machine learning tools.

* Autoencoders
* Classification 
* Regression 
* Covolutional Neural Networks
* Generative Adversarial Networks 
* Genetic Models(Neuroevolution) 
* Object Detection
* Style Transfer
* Reinforcement Learning(coming soon)

If you like what we are doing and want to support us, please consider donating at: https://paypal.me/neurales

We are a very small team working on a very large project with an even larger vision in mind.
	
# Features
* Plotting for visualization
* Disparate Impact Analysus for bias indications
* Neuroevolution for automated model creation and tuning
	
# Setup
